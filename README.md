# Motherboard v0.1

### How to Play
Much of the current iteration of **Motherboard** is centered around the backend systems that make the full fantasy of the game possible.

The game starts in the Motherboard Menu which already has one component. The player can use their mouse to drag the component to different places on the Motherboard.

Hitting ESC toggles the Motherboard Menu.

The player can use WASD to move around.
